<h1>Credential Attack Simulation Tool</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of a C program that attempts to crack up to 100 user-provided passwords (max 20 chars) using two methods. First, it checks each password against a leaked wordlist (rockyou.txt). If not found, a brute-force engine generates combinations (limited to 8 chars) from letters, numbers, and symbols. It reports total attempts and elapsed time (shows "instantly" if <0.01s) and offers to run again.
<br> </br>
Note that the program must be downloaded using Git Large File Storage (LFS). Alternatively, you can download it from the GitHub web app and replace the 'src/directories/rockyou.txt' file with a locally downloaded version (https://weakpass.com/wordlists/rockyou.txt).
